**Analyze-International-Debt-Statistics (PostgreSQL)**

In this project, we explore the debt that developing countries owe to the World Bank. Countries often take on debt to support economic needs such as infrastructure and social programs that contribute to citizens' quality of life. The World Bank is a significant provider of this financial assistance.

Using PostgreSQL, we analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. This dataset contains information about debt (in USD) across several categories for various countries. Our objectives include finding insights into debt distribution, understanding which countries carry the largest debt, and analyzing debt patterns across different indicators. The data spans national and regional debt statistics from 1970 to 2015.

**Prerequisites**

Database: PostgreSQL
1) Dataset: International debt data provided by The World Bank
2) Table Name: international_debt

**Objectives**

1)The World Bank's International Debt Data: Load and inspect the data to understand its structure and contents.

2)Finding the Number of Distinct Countries: Identify the unique countries in the dataset to get a scope of the dataset's global coverage.

3)Finding Out the Distinct Debt Indicators: Examine the different categories or indicators of debt to understand the purposes for which countries have borrowed.

4)Totaling the Amount of Debt Owed by the Countries: Calculate the total debt across all countries to get an overview of global debt levels.

5)Country with the Highest Debt: Find the country with the highest total debt and display the amount to understand its relative debt burden.

6)Average Amount of Debt Across Indicators: Compute the average debt per indicator across countries to reveal patterns in debt allocation.

7)The Highest Amount of Principal Repayments: Identify the maximum debt repayment amounts in the dataset to understand the distribution of high repayment obligations.

8)The Most Common Debt Indicator: Determine the most frequent debt indicator across countries, highlighting areas of common financial need.

9)Other Viable Debt Issues and Conclusion: Summarize findings and propose additional areas for further analysis, offering insights into economic conditions and debt trends.

**Usage**

Connect to the PostgreSQL database, create the international_debt table, and execute SQL queries to achieve the project objectives. Follow each objective sequentially for a structured analysis of the dataset.
